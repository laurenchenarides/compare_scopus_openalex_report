# Project Background {.unnumbered}

The DemocratizingData.ai platform currently uses Scopus, a fee-based service, to track USDA dataset usage. OpenAlex, an open-source alternative, offers potential cost savings and broader access. Moving to OpenAlex would reduce operational costs while maintaining public access to USDA’s dataset usage metrics. However, the decision to transition from Scopus to OpenAlex requires systematic evaluation of their coverage and data quality.

Initial comparisons between Scopus and OpenAlex revealed unexpected patterns in coverage overlap. These findings suggested that simply replacing one database with another might affect the platform’s ability to track dataset usage accurately.

## Project Objective {.unnumbered}

The objective of this project is to determine the coverage of publications across citation databases. This information will be used to decide the viability of replacing Scopus with a less costly solution.

## Specific Aims {#sec-aims .unnumbered}

1. **Evaluate differences in publication coverage across citation databases.** Compare how well Scopus, OpenAlex, and Dimensions track dataset usage in research publications and assess variations in publication inclusion.
2. **Assess journal coverage.** Determine which journals each platform indexes and analyze how these differences impact dataset visibility.
3. **Analyze publication-level discrepancies.** Compare how each platform captures research publications within indexed journals and identify potential gaps in dataset tracking.
4. **Examine author and institutional representation.** Investigate how each platform attributes authorship and institutional affiliations, with a focus on variations by research institution type (e.g., Minority-Serving Institutions).
5. **Develop a reproducible methodology for database comparison.** Establish a systematic approach for evaluating other citation databases beyond Scopus, OpenAlex, and Dimensions.

These aims guide the development of a methodology for comparing citation databases, focusing on four areas:

1.  Journal coverage: Determining which journals each platform indexes
2.  Publication tracking: Comparing how each platform captures publications within indexed journals
3.  Author identification: Evaluating how each platform handles author names and affiliations
4.  Institution recognition: Determining how each platform records and standardizes institutional information

The scope of work includes comparing publication coverage across Scopus, OpenAlex, and Dimensions. This inclusion provides a comprehensive assessment of citation databases, particularly in evaluating dataset coverage across both proprietary and open-access platforms. For more information on each citation database, refer to [this Appendix.](appendices/app_databases.qmd) 

Our methodology provides a systematic approach for assessing citation databases' strengths and limitations in tracking dataset usage across research papers. Beyond platform comparison, this methodology examines variations in dataset usage across different types of research institutions.

The methods described in this report can be applied to other citation databases as alternatives to current data sources.
