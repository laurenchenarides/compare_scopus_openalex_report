# Executive Summary

Federal agencies like the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) track how their datasets are referenced in research papers and disseminate data usage statistics through platforms like [DemocratizingData.ai](https://democratizingdata.ai/tools/dashboards/) and [NASS’s 5’s Data Usage Dashboard](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Data_Visualization/5W/index.php). This report presents a methodology for comparing citation databases as potential data sources for identifying dataset mentions within research papers, using Scopus, OpenAlex, and Dimensions as test cases. The methods described can be applied to evaluate other citation databases such as Web of Science, Crossref, and Microsoft Academic, to name a few.

Citation databases track academic research output. Different databases curate content (i.e., research output) in different ways - some focus on peer-reviewed journals while others include preprints and technical reports. Tracking dataset usage requires developing methods that scan publication text for dataset mentions. The accuracy of dataset tracking depends on the scope of research output we can access and analyze. Not to mention, dataset tracking requires reliable citation data from citation databases.

The **three** citation databases we are comparing are Elsevier’s Scopus, OurResearch's OpenAlex, and Digital Science's Dimensions.ai. **Scopus** (@sec-scopus) charges for access to its citation database. It focuses on peer-reviewed literature and provides metadata about authors, institutions, and citations for academic journals. **OpenAlex** (@sec-openalex), an open-source platform, offers free metadata access. It covers both traditional academic publications and other research outputs like preprints and technical reports. **Dimensions** (@sec-dimensions), developed by Digital Science, offers a hybrid model that provides both free and subscription-based access to its citation database. Unlike Scopus, which primarily indexes peer-reviewed journal articles, and OpenAlex, which emphasizes open-access content, Dimensions aggregates a broad spectrum of research outputs, including journal articles, books, clinical trials, patents, datasets, and policy documents. It integrates citation data with funding information, making it a useful tool for assessing the impact of research beyond traditional academic publishing.

Our methodology provides a systematic approach for assessing citation databases’ strengths and limitations in tracking dataset usage across research papers. We developed procedures for:

-   Identifying publication coverage across citation databases
-   Deduplicating author records
-   Standardizing institution names
-   Cross-referencing publications between datasets
-   Analyzing research themes and institutional representation

<!---Beyond platform comparison, this methodology examines inclusivity in research coverage, particularly representation of MSIs. This component helps identify potential gaps in dataset accessibility and adoption across different types of research institutions.--->

Our comparison of citation databases found:

-   After deduplication, the number of distinct authors decreased by XX% in Scopus and XX% in OpenAlex, indicating significant duplicate entries in the raw data
-   Institutional coverage was broader in XX, with XX% more institutions represented compared to XX
-   Analysis revealed XX major themes in USDA dataset usage, with ?? and ?? being the most prominent
-   Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) represented only XX% of institutional users, highlighting opportunities for broader engagement

The methodology produced these reusable components:

-   Code repository for data cleaning and standardization
-   Cleaned author tables with disambiguated names and institutional affiliations
-   Standardized institution tables using IPEDS identifiers
-   Crosswalk table structure linking Scopus and OpenAlex publication records, authors, and institutions
-   Data schema documentation \[Last updated: January 3, 2025\]

# Terminology

Citation databases form the foundation of modern research tracking and analysis. Digital repositories, like the test cases featured in this report, systematically catalog scholarly publications and their references to each other [@debellis2009bibliometrics]. Citation databases differ in their approaches to curating and maintaining this information. Some focus exclusively on peer-reviewed journal articles with strict inclusion criteria, while others index a broader range of research outputs including preprints, technical reports, and conference proceedings [@martin2021google; @mongeon2016journal]. These curation approaches affect how comprehensively each database captures research impact [@visser2021large].

Understanding how these databases work requires familiarity with bibliometrics - the statistical analysis of published works and their impact [@broadus1987toward]. Bibliometric analysis examines patterns in publication, citation networks, and research influence [@hood2001literature]. The field emerged from early citation indices, which mapped relationships between papers through their references [@garfield1955citation].

For tracking USDA dataset usage, these concepts directly apply. Accurate tracking of dataset usage in scientific literature serves multiple purposes. For federal agencies like the USDA, it helps monitor the return on public data investments, find gaps in dataset use, plan future data collection, and support evidence-based policy decisions. This tracking requires reliable citation data from citation databases. Unlike standard citations, researchers often reference datasets within the text of their publications rather than citing them formally. This makes tracking dataset usage more complex.

To solve this tracking challenge, methods have been developed that scan publication text for dataset mentions [@lane2022data]. The scope and accuracy of our dataset tracking depends on what publications we can access and analyze. Because different databases curate content in different ways, it creates variation in what dataset mentions they capture and their frequency. Variations in content across sources affect our ability to accurately track dataset impact and adoption. The DemocratizingData.ai platform, for example, uses bibliometric data to monitor these dataset usage patterns, helping USDA understand how its data supports research. By comparing how different citation databases track this information, we can better understand their strengths and limitations for monitoring research impact.

# Project Background

The DemocratizingData.ai platform currently uses Scopus, a fee-based service, to track USDA dataset usage. OpenAlex, an open-source alternative, offers potential cost savings and broader access. Moving to OpenAlex would reduce operational costs while maintaining public access to USDA’s dataset usage metrics. However, the decision to transition from Scopus to OpenAlex requires systematic evaluation of their coverage and data quality.

Initial comparisons between Scopus and OpenAlex revealed unexpected patterns in coverage overlap. These findings suggested that simply replacing one database with another might affect the platform’s ability to track dataset usage accurately.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to determine the coverage of publications across citation databases. This information will be used to decide the viability of replacing Scopus with a less costly solution.

### Specific Aims {#sec-aims}

1. Evaluate differences in publication coverage across citation databases – Compare how well Scopus, OpenAlex, and Dimensions track dataset usage in research publications and assess variations in publication inclusion.
2. Assess journal coverage – Determine which journals each platform indexes and analyze how these differences impact dataset visibility.
3. Analyze publication-level discrepancies – Compare how each platform captures research publications within indexed journals and identify potential gaps in dataset tracking.
4. Examine author and institutional representation – Investigate how each platform attributes authorship and institutional affiliations, with a focus on variations by research institution type (e.g., Minority-Serving Institutions).
5. Develop a reproducible methodology for database comparison – Establish a systematic approach for evaluating other citation databases beyond Scopus, OpenAlex, and Dimensions.

These aims guided the development of a methodology for comparing citation databases, focusing on four areas:

1.  Journal coverage: Determining which journals each platform indexes
2.  Publication tracking: Comparing how each platform captures publications within indexed journals
3.  Author identification: Evaluating how each platform handles author names and affiliations
4.  Institution recognition: Determining how each platform records and standardizes institutional information

Research partners at the University of Utah have access to Dimensions. The scope of work expanded to include Dimensions alongside Scopus and OpenAlex. This inclusion provides a more comprehensive assessment of citation databases, particularly in evaluating dataset coverage across both proprietary and open-access platforms.

Our methodology provides a systematic approach for assessing citation databases' strengths and limitations in tracking dataset usage across research papers. Beyond platform comparison, this methodology examines differences in research coverage, particularly the presence of MSIs. This component helps identify variations in dataset coverage and usage across different types of research institutions.

The methods described in this report can be applied to other citation databases as alternatives to current data sources.

# Project Workflow {#sec-workflow-overview}

The project workflow outlines the steps involved to evaluate how different citation databases track USDA dataset mentions in research papers. In searching for dataset mentions, the goal is to identify a set of publications that can be compared across the citation database test cases.

![](workflow/workflow.jpg)

The process of deriving the list of publications from a citation database consists of five steps:

**1. Define Data Assets and Aliases** (@sec-data)

-   Identify USDA datasets that will be searched for and tracked.
-   Collect official dataset names along with common abbreviations, acronyms, and alternative references used.

**Result:** A structured list of dataset names and aliases to be used for search strategies.

**2. Create a Seed Corpus** (@sec-seed-corpus)

-   Collect an initial set of publications.
-   Analyze how datasets are referenced.
-   Determine how well the dataset name variations (from Step 1) are retreived from the publications.
-   Adjust searches to improve accuracy.

**Result:** A set of seed publications to inform dataset identification and search procedures.

**3. Create a Publication Dataset for Dataset Mentions** (@sec-data-idn)

-   Extract dataset mentions using various search strategies:
    (1)   Full-Text (String) Search: Scan entire articles for relevant dataset names.
    (2)   Reference Search: Identify dataset citations within publication references.
    (3)   Machine Learning Models: Apply Kaggle competition models trained to detect dataset mentions.
    
**Result:** Different search routines yield different sets of publication results.

**4. Disambiguate Publication Results** (@sec-disambiguation)

-   Pre-process and clean publication metadata generated from each citation database.
-   Standardize journal, institution, and author names.
-   Deduplicate records.

**Result:** Cleaned publication metadata, removed of duplicates, inconsistencies, and missing information.

**5. Compare across Citation Databases** (@sec-matching)

-   Compare dataset coverage across Scopus, OpenAlex, and Dimensions.
-   Apply fuzzy matching techniques to identify overlapping and unique dataset mentions.
-   Analyze differences in journal coverage, citation patterns, and author affiliations.

**Result:** A set of statistics that can be used to evaluate dataset tracking accuracy.

## Step 1: Define Data Assets and Aliases {#sec-data}

The data assets featured here consist of those collected by the USDA, primarily from the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). These data assets are widely used in agricultural economics and food systems research. **The goal of this step is to compile a structured list of dataset names and their commonly used variations.**

### National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Data Assets

In late July 2023, an initial set of 21 reports were received containing a report name and a URL link to database curated by Cornell University. These reports are part of the USDA's efforts to track data usage across various research applications. However, the names of these reports were highly generic, making it difficult to precisely identify them in citation databases. Examples include reports titled "Agricultural Prices" and "Farm Labor," which lack specificity when compared to more structured dataset identifiers.

**Data Processing and Standardization**

To improve identification and searchability, the input was analyzed and transformed into a structured list that included:

-   International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSNs): Each of the 21 reports was assigned an ISSN, where available, to provide a standardized identifier.
-   Alias Creation: Generic report names were appended with the term report to better distinguish them from other similarly named publications in research literature.
-   Expanded Search Terms: Additional variations of dataset names were included to account for different citation styles and possible ways authors reference these reports.

The final dataset classification involved:

-   Main Data Asset (Parent Record): The original 21 reports, each representing a distinct dataset.
-   Aliases: ISSNs and URLs served as aliases to improve retrieval accuracy.
-   Search Term Expansion: Combining report names with different citation formats led to a total of 64 search terms (21 parent records + 43 aliases).

This standardization process improved the efficiency of identifying NASS datasets across publications indexed by citation databases such as Scopus, OpenAlex, and Dimensions.

### Economic Research Service (ERS) Data Assets

The process of identifying ERS data assets occurred in two phases: (1) an initial dataset compilation, and (2) a refinement process incorporating feedback from a team of agricultural economists at Colorado State University (CSU). This process was meant to yield a list of data assets was both comprehensive and relevant to the research community tracking USDA dataset usage.

**Phase 1: Initial Compilation of ERS Data Assets**

In October 2023, an initial list of 2,103 ERS records was compiled. These records included dataset names and, in some cases, associated aliases. The list was then reviewed by Professor Julia Lane, who identified and removed 144 records that were not suitable for machine learning-based dataset tracking.

**Reasons for Exclusion**

-   Records were too generic – Terms such as "Milk, Cotton, and CSV Format of National Data" were too broad to be meaningfully identified in citation databases.
-   Records were too specific – Entries such as "Table 15—Agricultural Chemical Input" and "Southeast: 1982-91, 1992-97" were references within broader reports rather than standalone data assets.

After these exclusions, the remaining 1,959 records represented the initial list of ERS data assets.

**Phase 2: Refinement with CSU Team**

A team of agricultural economists at CSU were consulted to refine the list so that it accurately captured key USDA datasets that may have been overlooked in the initial process. This involved:

-   Reviewing dataset usage in prior USDA research – Identifying which datasets were frequently cited.
-   Cross-checking with known data users – Ensuring that key datasets used by agricultural economists were included.
-   Expanding alias definitions – Recognizing dataset acronyms and alternative naming conventions.

As part of this process, an additional set of assets was incorporated, including datasets that had been previously identified in the Year 1 USDA project. Notably, datasets such as the Census of Agriculture and the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) were added, along with key acronyms like FoodAPS. This phase contributed:

-   12 new parent records
-   8 additional alias records
-   Total: 20 new search terms

**Final Data Asset Identification**

Unlike NASS data assets, which had ISSNs and DOIs, ERS datasets were primarily linked through URLs. The final structured dataset included:

-   1,959 parent records (main ERS datasets)
-   1,959 alias records (URLs serving as dataset identifiers)
-   20 additional records from the CSU consultation
-   Total: 3,918 search terms

Through this two-phase process, the list of ERS data assets evolved from an initial broad set of records into a refined, structured collection of datasets that could be effectively tracked across citation databases.

### Final List of USDA Data Assets

The data assets represent those most frequently used in agricultural economics research, spanning topics from farm management to food security. The final set of data assets, their producing agencies, and descriptions are presented in @tbl-usda-datasets.

: List of USDA Data Assets {#tbl-usda-datasets}

#### Appendix: Data Asset - Alias Dyads {.unnumbered}

To provide a comprehensive reference for dataset tracking, the following appendix includes a detailed list of data assets and their corresponding aliases, collectively referred to as dyads. Each dyad represents a dataset-name and alias pair used in citation database searches, allowing for more precise identification of dataset mentions in research publications. These aliases include acronyms, alternate spellings, dataset variations, and associated URLs, ensuring broad coverage across different citation practices. The dyad list serves as the foundation for dataset extraction and disambiguation across Scopus, OpenAlex, and Dimensions. A complete reference of these dataset aliases is included in [Appendix XX](appendices/app_dyads.qmd).

## Step 2: Create a Seed Corpus {#sec-seed-corpus}

After defining the data assets and aliases in Step 1 (@sec-data), the next step is to identify where these datasets are referenced in research publications. **The goal of this step is to establish a targeted search space by identifying publications most likely to reference the defined datasets.**

This seed corpus approach was only applied to Scopus; for OpenAlex and Dimensions, this procedure was not conducted, and dataset identification was instead performed through string searches across their entire publication records, described in @sec-data-idn.

For **Scopus**, a seed corpus was created to establish a targeted search space, balancing recall (capturing relevant mentions) and precision (minimizing false positives). This process included a restricted search strategy, using both reference lists and full-text searches, as well as machine learning-assisted review and manual refinements to resolve ambiguities, consolidate duplicate aliases, and incorporate missing terms. The refined seed corpus then informed the data identification step.

## Step 3: Create a Publication Dataset for Dataset Mentions {#sec-data-idn}

**The goal of this step is to build a dataset of publications that reference the dataset name aliases for the USDA data assets (@tbl-usda-datasets) across Scopus, OpenAlex, and Dimensions.** This dataset serves as the foundation for comparing publication coverage across citation databases.

To generate this dataset, the process requires:

- Dataset name aliases (from Step 1)
- Search routines tailored to each citation database to extract relevant publications

Search routines, described below, guide this step, as dataset mentions are often inconsistent across publications—appearing in titles, abstracts, full text, or reference lists. Scopus uses a structured seed corpus to refine searches, while OpenAlex and Dimensions rely on direct queries across their full publication records. The outputs of this step are three publication-level datasets, one for each citation database, which will be further analyzed in subsequent steps.

## Step 4: Disambiguate Publication Results {#sec-disambiguation}

According to @sec-aims, one of the goals of this analysis is to evaluate the differences in publication coverage across citation databases. 

To compare publication coverage across citation databases, we must first identify all journals that contain publications using each dataset in Scopus, OpenAlex, and Dimensions. @tbl-usda-datasets displays a list of the datasets for which we evaluate coverage. 

**The goal of this step is to standardize and resolve inconsistencies in publication records by disambiguating journal names, author affiliations, and institutions across the three databases.**

### Disambiguation Procedure

We create subsets of the publication dataset generated in Step 3, filtering by dataset mention. For example, if a publication references Ag Census, it is included in the Ag Census sub-dataset; otherwise, it is excluded. This process allows us to analyze dataset-specific publication patterns across Scopus, OpenAlex, and Dimensions.

Our analysis follows a hierarchical approach to understand how USDA data assets appear in these citation databases. 

1. **Journal Level** – We identify which journals publish research articles using USDA datasets to establish publication patterns. This step inherently involves looking within a journal’s publications to determine dataset mentions at the journal level—meaning that a journal is included if at least one of its publications references the dataset, but this does not indicate the overall prevalence of dataset usage within that journal.

2. **Publication Level** – We examine individual publications within these journals to understand the breadth of articles mentioning the dataset and how researchers use and cite USDA datasets in their work.

3. **Author Level** – We analyze the authors of these publications, tracking their institutional affiliations and research networks (e.g., coauthors). This provides another way to assess dataset reach, focusing on who is using the data rather than just where it appears.

4. **Institution Level** – We map dataset usage across institutions to understand where research using USDA data is concentrated geographically and across different types of research organizations. Like the author-level analysis, this offers an alternative lens on dataset dissemination.

This structured approach ensures that dataset mentions are analyzed consistently across databases, allowing for meaningful comparisons of coverage and research impact.

### Case Study: Census of Agriculture

::: {.custom-box}

To illustrate the disambiguation process, we use the Census of Agriculture as a case study to systematically compare coverage, overlap, and differences between the three citation databases. The Census of Agriculture (also referred to as "Ag Census") is widely used in agricultural and economic research, making it an ideal dataset for assessing database differences.

## Step 5: Compare across Citation Databases {#sec-matching}

Continuing with our case study, we now compare the two databases based on the journals that are unique to either Scopus or OpenAlex. Next, for journals that contain Ag Census data in both citation databases, we summarize the coverage of publications that appear in both Scopus and OpenAlex. Finally, we investigate discrepancies based on factors like missing identifiers, mismatched journal information (ISSNs), and additional publications accessed through OpenAlex’s API.
