### Journal Coverage {.unnumbered}

To analyze journal coverage in **OpenAlex**, we generate a dataset containing all unique journals that include at least one publication referencing Ag Census data. The OpenAlex journal-level dataset follows a similar approach to Scopus but differs in data availability and structure.

OpenAlex links journals to their respective publications using linkage files, which connect publication records to dataset mentions. Unlike Scopus, OpenAlex assigns a single dataset identifier per dataset, while Scopus may have multiple identifiers for the same dataset depending on how it is referenced.

Additionally, OpenAlex formats journal and publication identifiers differently:

- ISSNs appear without dashes
- DOIs exclude the URL portion, storing only the core identifier

To ensure consistency with Scopus, we clean and standardize the publication-level dataset, aligning DOIs and ISSNs to a common format.
