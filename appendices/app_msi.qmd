### Overview {.unnumbered}

The **Minority-Serving Institutions (MSI) Data** captures institutions eligible for federal MSI programs, as determined by the U.S. Department of Education and other sources. In this project, MSI data is used to analyze institutional characteristics in relation to research publications identified in Scopus, OpenAlex, and Dimensions.

This dataset provides information on institutions *eligible or potentially eligible* for at least one MSI designation and includes data from 2017 to 2023. The MSI dataset integrates information from multiple sources and is merged with IPEDS data to track research output across different institution types.

### How These Files Fit into the Project Workflow {.unnumbered}

The MSI dataset are used to:

1. Identify MSI-designated institutions within Scopus, OpenAlex, and Dimensions.
2. Compare research output across MSI and non-MSI institutions.
3. Analyze dataset usage at institutions serving underrepresented student populations.

By integrating MSI eligibility data with publication datasets, we can assess whether MSI institutions are underrepresented in academic research databases.

## Data Processing and Standardization {.unnumbered}

- **Variable Name Changes and Formatting:**
  - `year` was added to track MSI status over time.
  - `UNITID` is the primary key to merge MSI and IPEDS datasets.

- **Handling Missing Data and Filters:**
  - Institutions without `UNITID` were excluded.
  - Non-relevant columns were removed.

- **Merging Strategy:**
  - The 2017-2021 MSI data was directly compatible with IPEDS.
  - The 2022-2023 MSI data required additional formatting before merging.

## How to Merge with IPEDS Data {.unnumbered}

The MSI dataset can be linked with IPEDS data using the `UNITID` and `year` variables. This allows for:

- Tracking institutional MSI status over time.
- Comparing MSI and non-MSI institutions within Scopus, OpenAlex, and Dimensions.
- Assessing dataset usage patterns across different institution types.
