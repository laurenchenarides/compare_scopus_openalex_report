### Overview {.unnumbered}

The **Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS)** is a national dataset maintained by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). It collects data from all U.S. institutions participating in federal financial aid programs. In this project, IPEDS data is used to analyze institutional characteristics (e.g., size, classification, location, and financial indicators) in relation to research publications identified in Scopus, OpenAlex, and Dimensions.

The raw IPEDS data was obtained from the IPEDS website: <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/DataFiles.aspx?year=2023&surveyNumber=-1&sid=f98b3f39-0633-4dd3-bbc6-ec4e29b9098b&rtid=7" target="_blank">IPEDS Data Center</a>.

### How These Files Fit into the Project Workflow {.unnumbered}

The IPEDS dataset provides institutional characteristics that are used in:

1. Disambiguating institution names in citation databases (Scopus, OpenAlex, Dimensions)
2. Comparing research output across different types of institutions
3. Assessing dataset usage by institution type (e.g., HBCUs, land-grant universities, private vs. public institutions)

By integrating IPEDS institutional data with the publication datasets generated from each citation database, we can evaluate how research output varies across institution types and funding levels.

## Data Processing and Standardization {.unnumbered}

- **Variable Name Changes and Formatting:**
  - `UNITID` and `year` serve as the primary keys to merge datasets for analysis.
  - `year` was added to datasets that lacked it.

- **Handling Missing Data and Filters:**
  - Non-relevant columns were removed.
  - Datasets were filtered to retain only institutions with complete enrollment and classification data.

- **Merging Strategy:**
  - Datasets can be joined using `UNITID` and `year` as unique identifiers.
  - Institutions missing `UNITID` were excluded.

## How to Merge with MSI Data {.unnumbered}

The IPEDS dataset can be linked with the MSI dataset using the `UNITID` and `year` variables. This allows for:

- Identifying MSI institutions within IPEDS to analyze institutional characteristics.
- Comparing institutional characteristics of MSI and non-MSI institutions, such as enrollment size, Carnegie classification, and financial indicators.

::: {.callout-note}
After merging the IPEDS-MSI data with the cleaned institutional data from the citation databases, this dataset also allows for assessing research output and dataset usage by institution type, and examining trends over time in MSI status and institutional characteristics.
