This report presents a methodology for comparing citation databases as potential data sources for identifying dataset mentions within research papers, using Scopus and OpenAlex as a test case. The methods described can be applied to evaluate other citation databases such as Web of Science, Crossref, Dimensions, and Microsoft Academic, to name a few.\nCitation databases track academic research output. Different databases curate content (i.e., research output) in different ways - some focus on peer-reviewed journals while others include preprints and technical reports. Tracking dataset usage requires developing methods that scan publication text for dataset mentions. The accuracy of dataset tracking depends on the scope of research output we can access and analyze. Not to mention, dataset tracking requires reliable citation data from citation databases.\nThe two citation databases we are comparing are Elsevier’s Scopus and OpenAlex. Scopus charges for access to its citation database. It focuses on peer-reviewed literature and provides metadata about authors, institutions, and citations for academic journals. OpenAlex, an open-source platform, offers free metadata access. It covers both traditional academic publications and other research outputs like preprints and technical reports.\nOur methodology provides a systematic approach for assessing citation databases’ strengths and limitations in tracking dataset usage across research papers. We developed procedures for:\n\nDeduplicating author records\nStandardizing institution names\nCross-referencing publications between datasets\nAnalyzing research themes and institutional representation\n\nBeyond platform comparison, this methodology examines inclusivity in research coverage, particularly representation of MSIs. This component helps identify potential gaps in dataset accessibility and adoption across different types of research institutions.\nOur comparison of Scopus and OpenAlex found:\n\nAfter deduplication, the number of distinct authors decreased by XX% in Scopus and XX% in OpenAlex, indicating significant duplicate entries in the raw data\nInstitutional coverage was broader in XX, with XX% more institutions represented compared to XX\nAnalysis revealed XX major themes in USDA dataset usage, with ?? and ?? being the most prominent\nMinority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) represented only XX% of institutional users, highlighting opportunities for broader engagement\n\nThe methodology produced these reusable components:\n\nCode repository for data cleaning and standardization\nCleaned author tables with disambiguated names and institutional affiliations\nStandardized institution tables using IPEDS identifiers\nCrosswalk table structure linking Scopus and OpenAlex publication records, authors, and institutions\nData schema documentation [Last updated: January 3, 2025]\n\n\n\n2 Terminology\nCitation databases form the foundation of modern research tracking and analysis. Digital repositories, like Scopus and OpenAlex, systematically catalog scholarly publications and their references to each other (De Bellis, 2009). Citation databases differ in their approaches to curating and maintaining this information. Some focus exclusively on peer-reviewed journal articles with strict inclusion criteria, while others index a broader range of research outputs including preprints, technical reports, and conference proceedings (Martín-Martín et al., 2021; Mongeon & Paul-Hus, 2016). These curation approaches affect how comprehensively each database captures research impact (Visser et al., 2021).\nUnderstanding how these databases work requires familiarity with bibliometrics - the statistical analysis of published works and their impact (Broadus, 1987). Bibliometric analysis examines patterns in publication, citation networks, and research influence (Hood & Wilson, 2001). The field emerged from early citation indices, which mapped relationships between papers through their references (Garfield, 1955).\nFor tracking USDA dataset usage, these concepts directly apply. Accurate tracking of dataset usage in scientific literature serves multiple purposes. For federal agencies like the USDA, it helps monitor the return on public data investments, find gaps in dataset use, plan future data collection, and support evidence-based policy decisions. This tracking requires reliable citation data from citation databases. Unlike standard citations, researchers often reference datasets within the text of their publications rather than citing them formally. This makes tracking dataset usage more complex.\nTo solve this tracking challenge, methods have been developed that scan publication text for dataset mentions (Lane et al., 2022). The scope and accuracy of our dataset tracking depends on what publications we can access and analyze. Because different databases curate content in different ways, it creates variation in what dataset mentions they capture and their frequency. Variations in content across sources affect our ability to accurately track dataset impact and adoption. The DemocratizingData.ai platform, for example, uses bibliometric data to monitor these dataset usage patterns, helping USDA understand how its data supports research. By comparing how different citation databases track this information, we can better understand their strengths and limitations for monitoring research impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 References\n\nBroadus, R.
